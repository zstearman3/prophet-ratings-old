# ProphetRatings 2020 Application

This is an NCAA College Basketball Rankings application which focuses on 
predicting the outcome of future games. The app uses a postgresql database,
so be sure to have postresql installed before beginning.

To get started with the app, clone the repo and install the needed gems:
```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the databse:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
```
$ rails server
```
